EBP Testdata Generator

This Java project was developed for running user acceptance tests of changes to an e-book distribution platform. Testers require e-book files in different formats, metadata files in Onix 2.1 and Onix 3.0 format, and other files like e.g. cover images. The EBP Testdata Generator allows testers to generate those files for test purposes, based on some configurations that can be set in a graphical user interface.
